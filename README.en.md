### Introduction

Based on ArkTS, learn how to use the List component to implement lazy loading, pull-to-refresh, and bounce effect when the list reaches the bottom.

### Concepts

- Scroll: a component that is used to scroll the content when a component layout exceeds the viewport of its parent component.
- List: a component that provides a series of list items with the same width. It supports presentations of the same type of data in a multiple and coherent row style, for example, images or text.
- Tabs: a container component that allows you to switch between content views through tabs. Each tab corresponds to a content view.
- LazyForEach: a component that iterates data from provided data sources and creates corresponding components during each iteration.
